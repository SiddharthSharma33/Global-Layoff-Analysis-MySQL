Problem Statement: SQL Data Cleaning for Layoffs Dataset

Objective:
The objective of this project is to clean and standardize a dataset containing global layoff data from various companies in 2022. This dataset, which includes company names, locations, industries, and details about layoffs, contains inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values that need to be addressed to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

Background:
The layoffs dataset was obtained from a public source and contains records of layoffs from companies worldwide. The data includes fields such as company names, locations, industries, total employees laid off, dates of layoffs, and other related information. However, like many real-world datasets, it has issues that need to be resolved before it can be used effectively for analysis or reporting.

Key Issues to Address:
1. Duplicates:
   - The dataset contains duplicate records, which can skew analysis results if not properly handled. Identifying and removing these duplicates is crucial to maintain data integrity.

2. Inconsistent Data:
   - Variations in how data is recorded (e.g., different formats for dates, variations in industry names) need to be standardized. This ensures uniformity across the dataset, making it easier to analyze and interpret.

3. Missing Values:
   - The dataset has missing values in key fields like industry, total laid off, and percentage laid off. These gaps need to be addressed where possible by imputing missing data or determining if rows with missing data should be removed.

4. Data Formatting:
   - Fields such as dates are not in a standard format, and there are inconsistencies in text fields (e.g., trailing periods in country names). These issues need to be corrected to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

5. Unnecessary Data:
   - The dataset contains some columns and rows that do not add value to the analysis and may need to be removed to streamline the data.

Steps Involved:
1. Duplicate Removal:
   - Identify and remove duplicate records by comparing multiple columns that should uniquely identify a record.

2. Data Standardization:
   - Standardize industry names, country names, and other categorical fields to ensure consistency.
   - Convert dates to a uniform format and update any incorrect data types.

3. Handling Missing Values:
   - Analyze the missing values and decide whether to impute them or remove the affected rows based on their relevance and the availability of alternative data.

4. Column and Row Removal:
   - Remove unnecessary columns or rows that do not contribute meaningfully to the analysis, such as rows with missing key data or columns used temporarily during data cleaning.

Outcome:
The end result of this project will be a clean, standardized, and well-organized dataset that is ready for analysis. This clean dataset will enable accurate insights into global layoff trends in 2022, allowing for reliable reporting and data-driven decision-making. Additionally, the data cleaning process itself will provide a structured approach that can be applied to similar datasets in future projects.
